title="Lab Exercise: CSS Layout"
+++

The task in this lab session is to work in groups to produce a website with a fairly complex layout. In your group you should look at a website you visit often, and attempt to recreate that website layout using the HTML and CSS we have looked at to date.

**One person** should take the lead with coding, and the other(s) act as reviewers and editors, helping the lead coder create the code: suggesting solutions for implementation, watching for typos and minor errors, and providing feedback and evaluation. You will also be using Git for version control for the code on this exercise, and will share it to GitLab so that your entire group has access to the final code.

While working on your website, you should make a note of the things that work, the things that don’t work, what is easy to accomplish, and what has been tricky to do.

### Exercise

Decide in your group on a webpage that you visit regularly. Your task for today is to try to recreate the layout of this webpage. Note: you do not have to recreate any functionality - this is just about getting a feel for grouping content together and positioning it on the page. You can use real content or fake content (see below) - but if you use real content, please remember to reference the source.

Remember that you can use the developer tools in the browser to view the source code of the website you are visiting. For many websites, this code will be very complicated, and it may not be easy to understand how this all fits together. A better approach might be to look at the layout of the website you are attempting to recreate and think about how it is structured in terms of boxes of content, and how those boxes can be grouped together into larger boxes. This will allow you to think about how you might structure your HTML so that elements are grouped together inside other elements that can be positioned as a single unit.

### Resources

While working on your website you may find the following resources useful:

-   http://www.lipsum.com/ - allows you to generate filler ‘Lorem Ipsum’ text to use to pad out your website content while working on layout and design.

-   http://lorempixel.com/ - allows you to generate placeholder images to use on your website while working on layout and design.

### Peer Review

Once you have written a page in your group that you are happy with (or about half an hour before the end of the session, whichever comes first!) it is time to show it to another group and get their feedback!

You will be given a 'peer review' sheet to help with this activity. Fill out your group's details in the top boxes, then find another group in the room to pair up with. You should swap sheets with this group, and then show them the webpage you have created. They will look at your website and provide you with some feedback on it. While they are doing this, you should examine their website and answer the questions on the peer review sheet. Look at how the website looks, how it functions, the HTML features they have used. Feel free to look at their HTML and CSS code as well. Try to provide useful feedback that will help the other person improve their coding and design skills.

Once you have filled out the front of the peer-review sheet, hand it back to the group that created the website you reviewed. When they have finished reviewing your website they will return your sheet. You should read their feedback, think about it, and then answer the questions on the reverse of the sheet.

Once you have completed the peer review activity, hand your sheets back to either Martin or Daniela

Before you finish for the day, take a screenshot (or some screenshots) of your website and email them to ChorleyMJ@cardiff.ac.uk.
