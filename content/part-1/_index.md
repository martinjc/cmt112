Part 1 begins by examining the Internet, including how it works and its history. We then look at HTML and CSS, and issues surrounding modern web use such as responsive design and front end frameworks. We end by beginning to look at JavaScript as a programming language.

The web, and the software that runs on it is written in many different languages. However, for webpages, there are three basic languages you need to know: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

-   HTML is the language used to describe the structure and content of our webpage. It is not concerned with presentation or how the webpage will ultimately look, it is more focused on providing the document structure.
-   CSS is the presentational language, used to describe how the HTML and content of the page should be displayed.
-   JavaScript is the language used to add complex interactivity to the webpage. It executes in the browser and can manipulate parts of the webpage, and access data from elsewhere.

Later on we’ll look at more complex scenarios, involving extra code running on a back-end server behind a website, or running tools that create a website’s HTML, CSS and JavaScript from other languages, but for a simple website, these three languages are all you need. (Truthfully, HTML is all you need for a really simple webpage, but you’ll want to use CSS to make it look good, and you’ll want to know JavaScript so you can do the fun stuff later!).

### Week 1

During Week 1 we will cover the [fundamentals of the Internet](internet-intro) and using [HTML to add structure to content](html-and-css-intro), which allows us to create documents that can be understood by web browsers.

### Week 2

During Week 2 we will look at [styling our documents using CSS](html-css-and-layout). We'll learn how we tell the browser how it should layout and present our structured content. We'll also look at deploying our web pages to our GitLab server.

We'll also look at the first assessment for the module, where you will be tasked with implementing a new Website for a University.

### Week 3

During Week 3 we will look at creating web pages that work on all the devices that may access them by making them [responsive](responsive-css). We'll also look at CSS framework libraries which can simplify some of our development tasks.

### Week 4

In Week 4 we'll look at more advanced CSS layout techniques such as [Flexbox and CSS-Grid](responsive-css/responsive-css-2). We'll also start to look at the [JavaScript](../part-2) programming language.
