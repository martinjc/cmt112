## Overview
Now we can annotate our content and documents so a web browser can understand their structure, and can visually style that content and lay it out on a page, we will start to think about how our users access this content and what that means for our webpage design. We'll look at some of the simpler tools at our disposal to help us build pages that are accessible no matter what type of device our users are using.

### Compulsory Reading

* [Responsive Web design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) - One of the first articles written about the concept of responsive web design, and it still holds up as a 'manifesto' for modern web design practice
* [Mobile First Design - why it's great and why it sucks](https://mayvendev.com/blog/mobilefirst) - Another argument for responsive web design, this time working from the angle that we should design from the phone up, rather than the desktop down.
* [Responsive Images Done Right](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/responsive-images-done-right-guide-picture-srcset/)
* [Responsive Images - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) A good introduction to Responsive Images from MDN

### Helpful Links

* [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) - the MDN documentation on Media Queries.
* [Media Queries](https://mediaqueri.es/) - a useful gallery of responsive website designs.
* [Responsive Image Generator](https://www.responsivebreakpoints.com/) - a handy tool for generating different sizes and croppings of images for a responsive website - and all the HTML that goes along with it. The tool is explained and introduced in an [article on Smashing Magazine].(https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/01/responsive-image-breakpoints-generation/).
* [Responsive Images Example](https://ericportis.com/etc/cloudinary/) - a neat example of changing images based on the size of the page, so that features are cropped or included depending on the space available.
* [A Beginner's Guide to Wireframing](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399) - a helpful introduction to the first and sometimes trickiest part of building a website: designing the layout.

### Activities

In this contact session we will re-implement our page from last week (or build a new page) that works across a range of devices and screen sizes.

### Peer Review

Following this session, you will be asked to review one or more group's code, and leave them some constructive feedback on their website.  

## Code Examples

There are some example pieces of code for this topic. The source code for each example can be viewed in the GitLab project '[cmt112-examples](https://gitlab.cs.cf.ac.uk/scm2mjc/cmt112-examples)' and the end result can be seen on the [GitLab pages site for that project](http://scm2mjc.pages.cs.cf.ac.uk/cmt112-examples/).
