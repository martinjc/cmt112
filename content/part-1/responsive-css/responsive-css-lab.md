The task in this lab session is to work in your groups to make a responsive website - that is one that adapts to different types of device and screen size to ensure the user experience is optimal.

**One person** should take the lead with coding, and the other(s) act as reviewers and editors, helping the lead coder create the code: suggesting solutions for implementation, watching for typos and minor errors, and providing feedback and evaluation.

### This week's task

There are two options for this week's task:

1. Take the existing website that you have created in the previous weekâ€™s lab session. (NOTE: This should not be the coursework that you are currently working on individually!)
2. Create a new basic website from scratch. This can be on any topic, and does not need to be full of real content (lorem ipsum is fine).

Decide in your team where you would like to start from. Whichever you choose, ensure that the website you are working on has a realistic structure (multiple sections, paragraphs, navigation links, headers and footers etc). You can then either

1. Modify the existing website (if you are using one) to be responsive, and to work across multiple device sizes
   OR:
2. Create the new website from scratch to be responsive

You should refer to the class notes and the tutorials and articles we discussed earlier to help you in the task. You should not focus on the content of the website, but work to ensure that your structure and navigation is functional and usable across many different resolutions.

### Peer Review

Once you have written a page in your group that you are happy with (or about half an hour before the end of the session, whichever comes first!) it is time to show it to another group and get their feedback!

You will be given a 'peer review' sheet to help with this activity. Fill out your group's details in the top boxes, then find another group in the room to pair up with. You should swap sheets with this group, and then show them the webpage you have created. They will look at your website and provide you with some feedback on it. While they are doing this, you should examine their website and answer the questions on the peer review sheet. Look at how the website looks, how it functions, the HTML features they have used. Feel free to look at their HTML and CSS code as well. Try to provide useful feedback that will help the other person improve their coding and design skills.

Once you have filled out the front of the peer-review sheet, hand it back to the group that created the website you reviewed. When they have finished reviewing your website they will return your sheet. You should read their feedback, think about it, and then answer the questions on the reverse of the sheet.

Once you have completed the peer review activity, hand your sheets back to either Martin or Daniela
