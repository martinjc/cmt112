# 3. Server-Side Development

Part 3 completes the module by looking at developing back-end server applications including implementing APIs, storing and retrieving data in databases, and templating. We then finish the module by looking at build tools and other technologies which can improve the development process.

### Week 7

In Week 7 we will look at node.js and begin to understand how we might write application code on the Server that will respond to requests for information and deliver data or web pages to a client

### Week 8

In Week 8 we will look at REST APIs and the role they can play in a web application, looking at how we might request information or data from an API in a front-end website, and some of the issues facing building a website front-end for an API

### Week 9

In Week 9 we will look at some more advanced JavaScript techniques, including new language features and how to write modular, well-structured code.

### Week 10

In Week 10 we will look at tools and techniques that can improve our lives as developers, and allow us to build simple toolchains that will help get our code ready for production and live deployment.
