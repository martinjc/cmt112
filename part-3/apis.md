## Overview

In this section we look at REST APIs, what they are, and how to request data from them in our front-end websites. We'll look at a _relatively_ simple way to request data from an API - but be warned that we'll also look at a newer method next week.

### Compulsory Reading

## Code Examples

There are some example pieces of code for this topic. The source code for each example can be viewed in the GitLab project '[cmt112-examples](https://gitlab.cs.cf.ac.uk/scm2mjc/cmt112-examples)' and the end result can be seen on the [GitLab pages site for that project](http://scm2mjc.pages.cs.cf.ac.uk/cmt112-examples/).
