## Code Examples

There are some example pieces of code for this topic. The source code for each example can be viewed in the GitLab project '[cmt112-examples](https://gitlab.cs.cf.ac.uk/scm2mjc/cmt112-examples)' and the end result can be seen on the [GitLab pages site for that project](http://scm2mjc.pages.cs.cf.ac.uk/cmt112-examples/).
