## Activities

In this contact session we will start to think about CSS layout, and spend some time thinking about the common layouts we see and use often. In our groups we will examine some frequently used websites and try to evaluate the underlying structure and layout used. We'll then start implementing a layout using CSS, and will deploy the sites we create to Gitlab Pages.

## Peer Review

Following this session, you will be asked to review one or more group's code, and leave them some constructive feedback on their website.
