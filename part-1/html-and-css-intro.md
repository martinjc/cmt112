## Overview

Now we know what the Internet is, and we are beginning to get to grips with some of the technologies that allow the Web to operate, we'll start to look at the languages that allow us to create web pages.

## Compulsory Reading

The reading for this topic will introduce you to HyperText Markup Language, or HTML. This is actually the only language we need to know to be able to create web pages. We'll also look at the basics of CSS, and then Later on we'll find out about JavaScript too, but neither of those are actually necessary to create web pages. You'll need to have read and be comfortable with everything in this article before the contact session in Week 1.

* [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) - this is the introduction to HTML on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). MDN is a very good resource for web developers, it covers a lot of web technologies in depth and is very reliable. MDN should be one of the first places you look for documentation/tutorials on web technologies.
* [How CSS Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works) - this is a short introduction to CSS on MDN.

## Activity - Creating an HTML Page

During the [lab activity](part-1/labs/html-intro-lab) for this topic we will put what we have learnt into practice by individually creating a simple HTML web page. We will also practice using version control software to ensure our code is safely versioned and stored.
