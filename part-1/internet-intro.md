## Overview

In this topic, we start by looking at the history, structure and some of the key technologies of the Internet, and begin to think about the software that allows the World Wide Web to function, such as Servers and Web Browsers.

## Compulsory Reading

You will need to read (and make sure you understand) these articles before the contact session in Week 1. Remember, the compulsory reading is just a starting point - please do go off and read other sources. Follow links in articles and get lost in a weird corner of the web that remembers when it was all just Netscape and IE. If we're going to appreciate the web that we're working on today, we need to understand where it came from...

* Internet Society [Brief History of the Internet](https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/) - This is a great introduction to how the Internet (and so the WWW) came to be.
*  [The Evolution of the Web](http://evolutionofweb.appspot.com/?hl=en-gb) - This is now a little old, but gives a nice coverage of the evolution of web technologies from 1991 to 2012.


## Extra Reading

For instance, if you want to get a bit more background on the history of the web, you can do a lot worse than allow these articles to enter your eyeballs:

* Walt Howe [A Brief History of the Internet](http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html) - An anecdotal history of how the Internet came to be.
* [The Internet's history has just begun](https://ourworldindata.org/internet-history-just-begun)
* Wikipedia [History of the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet)
* Wikipedia [Web Browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)


## Activity - Buzzword Bingo

During the contact session for this topic we will assess our learning with a quick game of 'Buzzword Bingo'. This is like [Bingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(United_Kingdom), but I'm not drawing numbers. Instead, groups will be given a bingo card with a list of topics related to the Internet and the World Wide Web. Each group will try to mark off all the topics on their bingo card. Individual topics will be drawn by me at random using a clever algorithm. In order to mark the topic off your bingo card, someone or some group in the room will need to provide a description of the selected topic. As long as the description/definition is 'sufficient' to the satisfaction of all other groups, everyone in the room can mark off the topic. There will be prizes for the first vertical and horizontal row, and the first full house.
