## Responsive Web design

Now we can annotate our content and documents so a web browser can understand their structure, and can visually style that content and lay it out on a page, we will start to think about how our users access this content and what that means for our webpage design.

In this contact session we will examine web pages on a range of devices and see what works and what doesn't when it comes to mobile web design. We will then re-implement our page from last week (or build a new page) that works across a range of devices and screen sizes.

### Peer Review

Following this session, you will be asked to review one or more group's code, and leave them some constructive feedback on their website.
