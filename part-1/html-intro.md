## Overview

Now we know what the Internet is, and we are beginning to get to grips with some of the technologies that allow the Web to operate, we'll start to look at the languages that allow us to create web pages.

## Compulsory Reading

The reading for this topic will introduce you to HyperText Markup Language, or HTML. This is actually the only language we need to know to be able to create web pages. Later on we'll find out about CSS and JavaScript too, but neither of those are actually necessary to create web pages. You'll need to have read and be comfortable with everything in this article before the contact session in Week 1.
