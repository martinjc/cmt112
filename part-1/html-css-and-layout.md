## Overview

Having learnt about the way we structure our content to create web pages and add basic styling, we now start to look at the details of how CSS works and how to layout our pages using CSS.

## Compulsory Reading

The reading for this topic will begin to show you how to combine the structure of HTML with the presentation rules provided by CSS to style and layout your webpages.

* [Learn to Code HTML + CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) - this is a great introduction to combining HTML and CSS to create styled web pages. It is fairly in depth, and some of it will not be needed at this point, but you should be comfortable with all of this within the first few weeks of the course.
* [Learn CSS layout](http://learnlayout.com/) - this is a solid introduction to some basic CSS layout techniques. Later on we'll look at more advanced techniques, but the basic techniques covered in this tutorial will be fine for now.
* [All about Grid systems](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/all-about-grid-systems--webdesign-14471) - don't confuse this with CSS-Grid, which is a new CSS technology that makes implementing Grids easier. This is about the general design concept of using a Grid to layout content. 
* [Introduction to CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS) - this is a very thorough introduction to CSS and is probably best read in depth after you've read some of the other introductions and had a play with using CSS yourself. You've already read the first section `How CSS Works` in the previous section.

## Activity - CSS Specificity

In this activity we will test our understanding of how CSS is applied by Web Browsers. We will look at calculating CSS specificity and working out which CSS rule will apply to our HTML.

## Activity - Web Page Layout

In this activity we will start to think about CSS layout, and spend some time thinking about the common layouts we see and use often. In our groups we will examine some frequently used websites and try to evaluate the underlying structure and layout used. We'll then start implementing a layout using CSS, and will deploy the sites we create to Gitlab Pages.

## Activity - Peer Review

Following this session, you will be asked to review one or more group's code, and leave them some constructive feedback on their website through the GitLab repository. More instructions, and group allocations will be provided soon.
