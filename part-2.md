# 2. JavaScript Fundamentals

Part 2 is focused on JavaScript as a programming language in both the front-end and back-end of a modern web application. We look at using JavaScript to add interactivity to web-pages, responding to user input, and sending data to and from remote servers through API requests. We finish with a look at JavaScript on the server using Node.
