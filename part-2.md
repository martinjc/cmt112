# 2. JavaScript Fundamentals

Part 2 is focused on JavaScript as a programming language in both the front-end and back-end of a modern web application. We look at using JavaScript to add interactivity to web-pages, responding to user input, and sending data to and from remote servers through API requests. We finish with a look at JavaScript on the server using Node.

### Week 4

In Week 4 we'll start to learn about the [JavaScript programming language](part-2/intro-to-js). We'll look at how it's written, declaring variables and doing basic operations, and start to look at some methods of program control.

### Week 5

In Week 5 we'll continue looking at the JavaScript language, covering [more advanced concepts](part-2/more-js) like functions.

### Week 6

In Week 6 we'll start to look at using [JavaScript for interactivity](part-2/forms-events-dom) - responding to events and dynamically changing a webpage. We'll also look at building HTML forms.
