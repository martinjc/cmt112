## Assigment

Congratulations! You have just been hired as a junior web developer! For your first role at the company, you have been asked to produce a prototype website for an important potential client – PontyBridge University. 

The client has supplied some potential material for the website, and the company has given you some sketch outlines for the pages you need to create. 

In total, you need to create the following three pages:

1.	A homepage for the University.
2.	The ‘Study’ page, listing some courses they offer.
3.	The ‘Research’ page, listing some of their research projects.

Rough designs for each of the three pages have been supplied detailing how they should look at both large (desktop) and small (mobile) resolutions. You should try to match these designs as closely as possible. Additionally, the client has some suggestions on fonts and colours to use to match their existing branding.

In addition to the page designs, some potential content for the website has been provided:

1.	A selection of slogans to be displayed in the homepage banner
2.	A selection of quotes from past students to be displayed in the quote section of the homepage
3.	A selection of potential news headlines and descriptions to use for the news items on the homepage.
4.	A selection of marketing images for the University, along with their attribution information.

Outside of the supplied content, you are free to add content to the website however you wish. For instance, the ‘Study’ page lists a number of courses, but the client has yet to provide their titles and descriptions, so you are free to add these yourself. If other content is needed for your implementation, please feel free to either create this content yourself, or use standard filler content such as lorem ipsum text, creative commons images, or other freely available images. You should make sure to properly attribute sources of content in the source code for the website, or alongside the content itself.

The client has asked that valid  HTML and CSS is used wherever possible, and that the use of non-validating code is kept to a minimum. If non-validating code must be used, this should be explained and justified. With your website code, you are asked to submit a document containing the results of validation alongside justification for the non-validating code.
