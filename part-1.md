# Introduction to HTML, CSS & JS

Part 1 begins by examining the Internet, including how it works and its history. We then look at HTML and CSS, and issues surrounding modern web use such as responsive design and front end frameworks. We end by beginning to look at JavaScript as a programming language.

## The Internet

We start by looking at the history, structure and some of the key technologies of the Internet, and begin to think about the software that allows the World Wide Web to function, such as Servers and Web Browsers.

### Compulsory Reading

*  [The Evolution of the Web](http://evolutionofweb.appspot.com/?hl=en-gb) - This is now a little old, but gives a nice coverage of the evolution of web technologies from 1991 to 2012.

* Wikipedia [Web Browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)


### Activities

During the contact session for this topic we will assess our learning with a quick game of 'Buzzword Bingo'. Groups will be given a bingo card with a list of topics. Topics will be drawn at random. Groups will be invited to provide a description of the selected topic. Provided the description/definition is 'sufficient' to the satisfaction of all other groups, everyone in the room can mark off the topic. There will be prizes for the first vertical and horizontal row, and the first full house.


## Introduction to HTML

Now we know what the Internet is, and we are beginning to get to grips with some of the technologies that allow the Web to operate, so we'll start to look at the languages that allow us to create web pages.

* Writing an HTML Document
* HTML Elements
* Developing Locally - Simple Web Server
* Using Git
* Brief intro to CSS


### Activities

During the contact session for this topic we will put what we have learnt into practice by individually creating a simple HTML web page. We will practice using version control software to ensure our code is safely versioned and stored.   


## HTML + CSS

Having learnt about the way we structure our content to create web pages, we now start to look at how to visually style and layout our web pages using CSS.

### Compulsory Reading

* Learn to Code HTML + CSS
* Learn CSS layout
* All about Grid systems

### Videos

* CSS - Selectors and Specificity
* CSS - Positioning and Layout
* Gitlab Pages

### Activities

In this contact session we will start to think about CSS layout, and spend some time thinking about the common layouts we see and use often. We'll then start implementing a layout using CSS, and deploy the sites we create to Gitlab Pages.

### Peer Review

Following this session, you will be asked to review one or more group's code, and leave them some constructive feedback on their website.  

## Responsive Web design

Now we can annotate our content and documents so a web browser can understand their structure, and can visually style that content and lay it out on a page, we will start to think about how our users access this content and what that means for our webpage design.

### Compulsory Reading

* Responsive Web design
* Mobile First Design - why it's great and why it sucks
* Don't overthink it Grids

### Videos

* Mobile First + responsive
* Media queries
* Responsive images
* CSS frameworks
* Units and sizing

### Activities

In this contact session we will examine web pages on a range of devices and see what works and what doesn't when it comes to mobile web design. We will then re-implement our page from last week (or build a new page) that works across a range of devices and screen sizes.

### Peer Review

Following this session, you will be asked to review one or more group's code, and leave them some constructive feedback on their website.
