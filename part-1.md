# Introduction to HTML, CSS & JS

Part 1 begins by examining the Internet, including how it works and its history. We then look at HTML and CSS, and issues surrounding modern web use such as responsive design and front end frameworks. We end by beginning to look at JavaScript as a programming language.

### Week 1

During Week 1 we will cover the [fundamentals of the Internet](part-1/internet-intro) and using [HTML to add structure to content](part-1/html-intro), which allows us to create documents that can be understood by web browsers.

### Week 2

During Week 2 we will look at [styling our documents using CSS](part-1/html-and-css). We'll learn how we tell the browser how it should layout and present our structured content. We'll also look at deploying our web pages to our GitLab server.

We'll also look at the first assessment for the module, where you will be tasked with implementing a new Website for a University.

### Week 3

During Week 3 we will look at creating web pages that work on all the devices that may access them by making them [responsive](part-1/responsive). We'll also look at CSS framework libraries which can simplify some of our development tasks. 

### Week 4

In Week 4 we'll  look at more advanced CSS layout techniques such as Flexbox and CSS-Grid. We'll also start to experiment with JavaScript.
