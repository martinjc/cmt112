# Introduction to HTML, CSS & JS

Part 1 begins by examining the Internet, including how it works and its history. We then look at HTML and CSS, and issues surrounding modern web use such as responsive design and front end frameworks. We end by beginning to look at JavaScript as a programming language.

## The Internet

We start by looking at the history, structure and some of the key technologies of the Internet, and begin to think about the software that allows the World Wide Web to function, such as Servers and Web Browsers.

### Activities

During the contact session for this topic we will assess our learning with a quick game of 'Buzzword Bingo'. Groups will be given a bingo card with a list of topics. Topics will be drawn at random. Groups will be invited to provide a description of the selected topic. Provided the description/definition is 'sufficient' to the satisfaction of all other groups, everyone in the room can mark off the topic. There will be prizes for the first vertical and horizontal row, and the first full house.


## Introduction to HTML

Now we know what the Internet is, and we are beginning to get to grips with some of the technologies that allow the Web to operate, so we'll start to look at the languages that allow us to create web pages.
